# DTW
Dynamic Time Warping 
Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences which may vary in speed. For instance, similarities in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking faster than the other, or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation. It can be used to match a sample voice command with others command, even if the person talks faster or slower than the prerecorded sample voice. DTW can be applied to temporal sequences of video, audio and graphics data-indeed, any data which can be turned into a linear sequence can be analyzed with DTW.

In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences with certain restrictions. But let's stick to the simpler points here. Let's say, we have two voice sequences Sample and Test, and we want to check if these two sequences match or not. Here voice sequence refers to the converted digital signal of your voice. It might be the amplitude or frequency of your voice that denotes the words you say
